The company’s executive team is concerned about the results of a high-level internal feasibility study that flagged a potential risk to the launch of this treatment – a rumored shortage of infusion capacity in the US. Given that the Alzheimer's treatment is designed to be administered via infusion, such a shortage would severely hamper the market acceptance and hence the financial rewards from the treatment.
